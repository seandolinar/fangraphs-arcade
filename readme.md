This is an NES 6502 assembly project coded to use the ca65 assembler.

The `.nes` file is built game ROM and should work on any NES emulator or hardware.

To build the ROM file:

```
./makeGame
```

That bash script contains the assembler and the linker commands.

The ca65 assembler is part of the cc65 package and install instructions can be found here: http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Installing_CC65
