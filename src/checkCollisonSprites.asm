; this is actually doing something
; but it's not right
; let's get rid of the X loop
; let's make this separate so it just checks if they are in the same place.
; if this is kept on a grid, we can just compare the straight up X/Y RAM coords without much math

;; this loop won't work because it will only stop if it's the last one.
;; so i might need to invert this whole thing
