# JSNES Web UI

This is a JavaScript Web application based on [JSNES-Web](https://github.com/bfirsh/jsnes-web). I have retained the original [README](./README_Original.md).  The package author has suggested that copy / pasting is best way to embed the emulator into another JS app.

## Install
    $ npm install

## Running in development

    $ npm run start

## Building for production

    $ npm run build

The built app will be in `build/`.  The project is configured to be servere from a `/nes` subdirectory.
